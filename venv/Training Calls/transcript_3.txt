User: So, from this Jodo,
Agent: we push to the NBFC.
User: NBFC?
Agent: NBFC means Non-Bank Finance Company.

Agent: I have told you this case before.
User: It is Bajaj, sir.
Agent: But my father didn't agree.
User: He didn't agree.

User: Why do we need Bajaj, Vatra?
Agent: So, you didn't even try.
User: No, sir.
Agent: He said it 2-3 times.
User: But he said there will be discounts.
Agent: No discounts.
User: It is safe for now.
Agent: Why do we need to convert?
User: What is safe?
Agent: It is very dangerous if you are late.
User: If you are late, it is like NBFC.
Agent: It is dangerous there.
User: I won't say it is dangerous there.
Agent: Otherwise, you will have direct support from us.
User: Similarly, if you want to become a master,
Agent: you should be in NBFC.

User: Rs.15,000.
Agent: You will get this for a certificate.
User: Rs.15,000?
Agent: Rs.15,000 to Rs.25,000.
User: You are smart.
Agent: Are you a genius?
User: Are you smart or a genius?
Agent: I am a genius, sir.
User: You don't need a genius.
Agent: Do you need a genius?
User: No.
Agent: If you are there,
User: you will get Rs.15,000.
Agent: Your mentor will guide you.
User: Okay, ma'am.
Agent: Why do you refuse?
User: Tell me the reason, ma'am.
Agent: I don't want to tie-up with Bajaj.
User: I don't want to tie-up with Bajaj.
Agent: Why Bajaj?
User: I want to pay the entire payment.
Agent: Entire payment?
User: We have no cost here.
Agent: We have no cost here.
