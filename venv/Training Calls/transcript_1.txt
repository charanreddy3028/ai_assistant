User: The thing is, we'll do the process.
Agent: I'll be there to take care of it.
User: If you can take half an hour,
Agent: half an hour is not a complete half an hour.
User: Just 10 minutes to complete the process.
Agent: After that, there's a verification call,
User: 10 minutes.
Agent: If there's an approval,
User: 10 minutes for post-approval steps.
Agent: That's all it takes.
User: Okay?
Agent: Okay.
User: So, not immediately,
Agent: you'll give a little gap.
User: I'll check once,
Agent: in the perspective of how much the training amount is.
User: Previously,
Agent: whom did you do EMI process with, Dad?
User: I have no idea.
Agent: I'm asking whom you did EMI with.
User: You thought it was for you and me in the beginning.
Agent: Yeah, I thought it was for them.
User: Normally,
Agent: did you do EMI with Dad or mom?
User: With Dad.
Agent: Okay, you did it with Dad.
User: I'll check.
Agent: Who is Dasani Devi, Dad?
User: Mom.
Agent: Okay.
User: You did it with Mom.
Agent: That's why it's not working.
User: Why aren't you trying with Dad?
Agent: I don't know.
User: Dad and EMI don't work for me.
Agent: Okay.
User: I'm getting disconnected from Dad's account.
Agent: I don't understand.
User: I'm getting disconnected from Dad's account.
Agent: Why did you give Mom's details when you disconnected from Dad's account?
User: I don't know.
Agent: I'm getting disconnected from Dad's account.
User: You're getting disconnected from Dad's account.
Agent: Generally,
User: you said you have a shop.
Agent: Do you take care of the shop or only Dad?
User: Only Dad.
Agent: Only Dad.
User: Fine.
Agent: Check it once.
User: You're getting disconnected from Dad's account.
Agent: Check it once.
User: If it's simple for Dad,
Agent: try to work with Dad.
User: You don't have to work with Dad.
Agent: If you work with Dad,
User: you'll be able to complete your cross.
Agent: They won't ask for your additional details.
User: Okay?
Agent: Okay.
User: I don't think Dad has a loan.
Agent: Dad has a loan.
User: Dad has a loan.
Agent: If you don't pay the loan on time,
User: you won't have a loan.
Agent: Do you pay the loan on time?
User: I pay the loan on time.
Agent: You have a loan.
User: I have a 12 lakh loan.
Agent: I don't want to pay the loan on time.
User: Why not, Dad?
Agent: Let me tell you something.
User: There's something called FOIL.
Agent: How much income do we get?
User: How much loan did we take previously?
Agent: All the cuttings are gone.
User: What's left for them?
Agent: For example,
User: a dog costs Rs. 30,000.
Agent: If I have Rs. 30,000,
User: they won't give it to me.
Agent: Because,
User: if I pay the loan on time,
Agent: I'll be able to pay school fees,
User: college fees,
Agent: and rent.
User: They'll give it to me like that.
Agent: If I have Rs. 30,000 income,
User: even if I have to pay Rs. 15,000 every month,
Agent: I'll pay the rent in the remaining Rs. 15,000.
User: I'll see what I can pay.
Agent: I'll be able to pay this girl here.
User: Do you understand?
Agent: That's what I said.
User: So, they'll look at it like that.
Agent: They'll look at it from this perspective.
User: They call it FOIL.
Agent: Try talking to your father.
User: Because my mother is a housewife,
Agent: I can't talk to her.
User: Everything has changed now.
Agent: Okay?
User: If we keep working,
Agent: if we keep working,
User: if we have a civil score,
Agent: the process will be simple.
User: What will happen to you additionally?
Agent: Last time, you talked to your mother.
User: The process.
Agent: I don't think it'll happen.
User: Why not?
Agent: Your mother doesn't have an income.
User: They'll look at the probability score.
Agent: Will she get income?
User: Normally, they say Devi Paan Shop.
Agent: Do you really run a paan shop?
User: Yes.
Agent: Do you run a paan shop?
User: Yes.
Agent: Why do you call yourself a housewife?
User: I said that last time.
Agent: It's normal.
User: What do you mean by normal?
Agent: If you call yourself a housewife,
User: you'll get a normal income.
Agent: I see.
User: If you run a paan shop,
Agent: who pays for it?
User: It's not the phone.
Agent: It's my mother.
User: I don't understand.
Agent: It's not the phone.
User: It's my mother.
Agent: Okay.
User: So, your mother pays for the paan shop.
Agent: Do you have minimum transactions?
User: Yes.
Agent: If NBFC asks for a 6-month bank statement,
User: can you provide it?
Agent: Yes.
User: I can provide it.
Agent: You can provide a 6-month bank statement.
User: In case we don't have a CIBIL score, if we have a good CIBIL score and we have good transactions in our account, they will definitely give us an approval.
Agent: They don't ask us what we normally do and how much income we get. They just give us an approval and that's it.
User: Can you tell me your mother's number? I will check it right now.
Agent: Are you at home or at the hostel? I am at the hostel.
User: I thought you will check it on your mother's phone.

Agent: Because of that...
User: Okay.
Agent: So, now,
User: if you link it to Aadhar PAN,
Agent: what will happen to IBAN, dad?
User: I didn't understand what you said.
Agent: My dad doesn't accept income tax.
User: He doesn't accept income tax.
Agent: If he accepts income tax,
User: it will go to the White House.
Agent: Okay.
User: What does your parents do?
Agent: My dad owns an automobile shop.
User: My mom is a housewife.
Agent: Mom is a housewife.
User: So, now,
Agent: this girl will be linked to your dad's name?
User: Yes.
Agent: My brother doesn't accept income tax.
User: My dad doesn't accept income tax.
Agent: Because of that,
User: my dad doesn't accept income tax.
Agent: If he accepts income tax,
User: it will go to the White House.
Agent: It doesn't matter if the card is lost.
User: I didn't understand, dad.
Agent: Can you say it again?
User: You said,
Agent: I didn't understand until you said,
User: you will do it later.
Agent: I didn't understand before.
User: Now, we don't have a white card.
Agent: Now, we have a ration card.
User: Yes.
Agent: All the policies will come
User: if we have a white card.
Agent: Okay.
User: Now, if you accept income tax,
Agent: this white card won't be lost.
User: Is that it?
Agent: Yes.
User: Okay. Fine. Fine.
Agent: Apart from that,
User: apart from Bajajan,
Agent: here, Varthana,
User: Feemong,
Agent: Money View,
User: Varthana,
Agent: I forgot.
User: In Varthana,
Agent: we tried to get income tax,
User: last time.
Agent: Okay.
User: Then, what happened next?
Agent: In that process,
User: we said,
Agent: that it shouldn't be changed.
User: Aadhar card link,
Agent: PANaxe,
User: in Feemong,
Agent: because of that,
User: it happened.
Agent: We said,
User: we will change it when it comes.
Agent: Keep PANaxe aside.
User: If Aadhar card has a link
Agent: with my dad's number,
User: it will be enough, right?
Agent: Yes, ma'am.
User: Link is enough.
Agent: But,
User: income tax,
Agent: if we pay income tax,
User: how can we transfer money?
Agent: No, dad.
User: I am here now.
Agent: Even if I don't pay income tax,
User: because Aadhar card has a link with my dad's number,
Agent: Aadhar card is mine, right?
User: Did you understand what I said?
Agent: So,
User: once,
Agent: find your dad clearly.
User: Now,
Agent: if they ask for ITR,
User: income tax,
Agent: returns,
User: certificates should be provided.
Agent: Are you talking about that?
User: Otherwise,
Agent: for dad's Aadhar card,
User: for dad's PAN card,
Agent: if dad's number has a link,
User: it will be enough.
Agent: I understood.
User: Are you asking me to change Vartana, ma'am?
Agent: No, dad.
User: You have Vartana,
Agent: Bajaj,
User: Manivya,
Agent: and many more.
User: I am asking you
Agent: because I want to see
User: why you are still continuing.
Agent: Previously,
User: you tried Vartana,
Agent: but,
User: if it didn't work,
Agent: why didn't you try other investments?
User: Didn't you find it?
Agent: No, ma'am.
User: Normally,
Agent: we too,
User: have the same finance.
Agent: Yes,
User: we have the same finance,
Agent: but,
User: Jodo is not a finance.
Agent: Jodo is like,
User: I will tell you,
Agent: Jodo is like a second party.
User: Now,
Agent: if it is for the next wave,
User: how will it be?
Agent: Now,
User: it is difficult for everyone
Agent: to have a link.
User: Some people
Agent: do it knowingly or unknowingly.
User: Now,
Agent: if you are not able to process because of that,
User: if you miss your classes here,
Agent: Jodo will tell you
User: not to miss it.
Agent: Jodo is always temporary.
User: Now,
Agent: if you remove Jodo completely,
User: what will happen to you?
Agent: Opportunities,
User: learning,
Agent: you are paying so well,
User: but,
Agent: you are tied up with the second party,
User: so,
Agent: further,
User: the effect will be on us,
Agent: right?
User: You come and do it urgently,
Agent: but,
User: the team cannot do it.
Agent: That's what I am telling.
User: You are paying correctly
Agent: from so many months.
User: If you do it with NBFC,
Agent: you can become a master degree
User: certificate.
Agent: Further,
User: if there are any opportunities,
Agent: first,
User: the team will inform you,
Agent: right?
User: Yes,
Agent: okay.
User: Generally,
Agent: Jodo is not a normal part,
User: right?
Agent: It came from you,
User: right?
Agent: Yes,
User: that is the second part,
Agent: right?
User: Now,
Agent: why do Jodo do it?
User: Maybe,
Agent: because we do not have a CD then,
User: or,
Agent: it is called right complicant.
User: Do you have an idea?
Agent: Because they do not get it,
User: the process will be delayed for you.
Agent: If the classes are delayed,
User: then,
Agent: in that perspective,
User: what will you do?
Agent: In Jodo,
User: the process will be completed,
Agent: temporarily,
User: and,
Agent: in case,
User: after 2 months,
Agent: 3 months,
User: our team will contact you,
Agent: and,
User: they will try to change it
Agent: in the normal NBFC.
User: In case,
Agent: that is not possible,
User: then,
Agent: they will contact you,
User: and,
Agent: they will contact you,
User: and,
Agent: they will contact you,
User: and,
Agent: they will contact you,
User: and,
Agent: they will contact you,
User: and,
Agent: they will contact you,
User: and,
Agent: If you can't do it permanently, they will give you 1-2 months time to do it again.
User: Because you can't do it all at once.
Agent: They will give you time to see if you can't do it on a daily basis.
User: It's different to take it that way.
Agent: But it's not right to not know the reason for not being able to move completely.
User: Okay, ma'am.
Agent: So, when it comes to the finance, what are we supposed to do next month?
User: Since the amount has already been paid in Jodo,
Agent: if you convert to normal NBFC,
User: what happens then?
Agent: What do you call it?
User: The normal finance will be paid from next month.
Agent: That's it.
User: Okay.
Agent: So, we're taking it out of this and putting it in this.
User: In case it happens here,
Agent: it will continue in NBFC.
User: In case it doesn't happen,
Agent: you'll be in Jodo.
User: You can proceed further with Ride Complicants.
Agent: If not,
User: you'll have to talk to the team.
Agent: Okay?
User: Okay.
Agent: It's simple.
User: You don't have to do anything.
Agent: You already have class access.
User: You're listening to the classes, right?
Agent: There's no problem with that.
User: You don't have to pause classes anywhere.
Agent: The thing is,
User: we'll do the process.
Agent: I'll stay close and take care of it.
User: If you can keep half an hour,
Agent: half an hour is not a complete half an hour.
User: Just 10 minutes to complete the process.
Agent: If there's a verification call,
User: it'll take 10 minutes.
Agent: If there's an approval,
User: it'll take 10 minutes for the post-approval steps.
Agent: If you can keep time,
User: it'll be done.
Agent: Okay?
User: Okay.
Agent: So, not immediately,
User: they'll give you a gap.
Agent: I'll check once
User: to see how much the remaining amount is.
Agent: Previously,
User: with whom did you do the EMI process?
Agent: I don't understand.
User: I'm asking,
Agent: with whom did you do the EMI process?
User: At the start,
Agent: I think it was Navya.
User: I'm not with them.
Agent: Normally,
User: did you do the EMI process with your father
Agent: or with your mother?
User: With my father.
Agent: Okay,
User: you did it with your father.
Agent: I'll check once.
User: Who is Dasani Devi?
Agent: She's my mother.
User: Okay.
Agent: You did it with your mother.
User: That's why it's not working.
Agent: Why aren't you trying with your father?
User: I don't know.
Agent: My father doesn't accept EMI.
User: Okay.
Agent: I'm getting disconnected from my father's account.
User: I don't understand.
Agent: I'm getting disconnected from my father's account.
User: Why did you give your mother's details
Agent: instead of your father's account?
User: I don't know.
Agent: I'm getting disconnected from my father's account.
User: You're getting disconnected from your father's account.
Agent: Generally,
User: you said there's a shop, right?
Agent: Yes.
User: Do you take care of the shop
Agent: or only your father?
User: Only my father.
Agent: Only your father.
User: Okay.
Agent: Check it once.
User: You're getting disconnected from your father's account.
Agent: Check it once.
User: There's no harm in proceeding with your father.
Agent: If you proceed with your father,
User: you'll be able to complete the process quickly.
Agent: They won't ask for your additional details.
User: Okay?
Agent: Okay.
User: My father's account should be there.
Agent: He has a loan.
User: Only your father has a loan.
Agent: If you don't pay the loan on time,
User: you won't have a loan.
Agent: Are you paying the loan on time?
User: I'm paying it on time.
Agent: You'll have a loan.
User: I have a 12 lakh loan.
Agent: I don't want to pay the loan.
User: Why not?
Agent: I'll tell you something.
User: There's a form.
Agent: It shows the income we get.
User: It shows how much we took out from the previous loan.
Agent: It shows the amount of money we took out.
User: It shows the amount of money we took out.
Agent: Let's say I have 30,000 rupees.
User: My father won't give me 30,000 rupees.
Agent: Because,
User: we have to pay the loan next year.
Agent: We have to pay the school fees and rent.
User: He'll give it to me.
Agent: If I get 30,000 rupees,
User: I'll pay the loan for 15,000 rupees.
Agent: I'll pay the loan every month.
User: I'll pay the rent on the remaining 15,000 rupees.
Agent: I'll see what I have to pay.
User: I can pay that amount here.
Agent: Did you understand?
User: They'll look at it like that.
Agent: They'll look at it from this perspective.
User: They'll give it to me.
Agent: They call it POIR.
User: Let's see if I can talk to my father.
Agent: Because,
User: my mother is a housewife,
Agent: I have to proceed with my mother.
User: Everything has changed now.
Agent: Is it okay?
User: Let's say I'm working.
Agent: Hello.
User: Hello.

User: If we have a civil score,
Agent: the process will be simple.
User: What will happen to you additionally?
Agent: Last time, you worked with your mother.
User: The process.
Agent: I don't think I'll be able to do it.
User: Why not?
Agent: Does your mom have any income?

Agent: Does she get any income?
User: It's normal here
Agent: They say Devi Paan Shop
User: Do you really run a paan shop?
Agent: Yes
User: Do you run a paan shop?
