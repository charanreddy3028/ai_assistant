Agent: So, if you see, you are continuing to pay the entire fees, right?
User: So, if you continue that growth, you will get the entire certification that you have learned the course.
Agent: And maybe you have developed some projects or websites from here, right?
User: So, you get the full certificate of all that, which is accepted everywhere.
Agent: You can do an internship now and go ahead and become a permanent employee there.
User: So, there too, you may get some benefits because you will have the certificate of exercise skills, right?
Agent: So, you can...
User: No, that's not true.
Agent: I mean, my plan was to continue again.
User: Because, you see, there is no cyber security, which is being taught here.
Agent: Okay, okay.
User: Because all this was very new, so it took time for me to adjust.
Agent: Okay.
User: So, I mean, once I get an internship, whatever it is, because it's an electrical company,
Agent: I will most probably think that I will shift to web development in the future or just development accordingly.
User: So, I will continue again next year.
Agent: But for now, I want to gain a little experience so that I can mention it in the resume in the future.
User: I liked that a lot.
Agent: Because the more experience you take, the better your placement will be.
User: You know that, right?
Agent: So, this is a very good thing that you have thought.
User: And you have already created a static or responsive website from Nextcloud.
Agent: You have also solved the first problem of SQL and Python, right?
User: You have also done a dynamic web application.
Agent: So, you can continue the remaining part.
User: No issue.
Agent: So, first I will tell you about learning performance.
User: Basically, I work as a relationship manager in Nextcloud.
Agent: And maybe you must have talked to me about starting where I did your EMI process.
User: Right?
Agent: You might remember.
User: So, 65% is your overall performance.
Agent: Okay?
User: So, now I called you because first I wanted to tell you about your learning performance.
Agent: Second, I wanted to inform you about your EMI.
User: Like you joined Nextcloud two years ago.
Agent: Correct?
User: Almost two years, right?
Agent: So, basically, you were given two options here.
User: First, full payment.
Agent: And second, Digital Loan No Cost EMI.
User: You were told about it.
Agent: Your Genius Program.
User: Where you selected the second option, Digital Loan No Cost EMI.
Agent: And there you had put a document of someone else.
User: You had put a document of your parents, right?
Agent: Yes.
User: Whose bank card did you put?
Agent: It was mine.
User: Okay.
Agent: And your EMI was going from your account, right?
User: Yes.
Agent: But at that time, you didn't have any source of income.
User: That's why we did your process in pairs, right?
Agent: Yes.
User: So, now you have become a civil.
Agent: Like now, all your EMI has gone from time to time.
User: Or has your EMI ever been late?
Agent: According to me, my COVID score is not showing anything right now.
User: Actually, this was my last call.
Agent: Sir had called me.
User: He had checked my COVID score.
Agent: He had shared it on the screen.
User: I had shown it to him.
Agent: He didn't want to show it to me.
User: So, I said, it's okay.
Agent: Let's do it this way.
User: So, that's how it happened.
Agent: Okay.
User: Okay.
Agent: So, who called?
User: Madhur sir?
Agent: No.
User: I don't remember.
Agent: Sorry.
User: I don't remember.
Agent: Your voice is breaking.
User: Hello.
Agent: I don't remember the name.
User: Okay.
Agent: How long ago did you get a call?
User: Can you tell me?
Agent: I got a call 6 months ago.
User: Okay.
Agent: And which account is your bank using to pay your EMI?
User: Kotec Bank.
Agent: Okay.
User: So, your EMI is going from Kotec Bank.
Agent: Okay.
User: So, I got a call from Kotec Bank to tell them that my EMI is going from Kotec Bank.
Agent: So basically, if you have been paying EMI from time to time for 2 years, your EMI must
User: have been on Google Pay or PhonePay.
Agent: By paying your EMI from time to time, you get a civil gain.
User: Okay.
Agent: So basically, I called you because your EMI was going from Jodoh.
User: But you would have got a call from the sir.
Agent: He would have told the same thing.
User: That our Jodoh is temporary access.
Agent: So your EMI will go from MBFC.
User: Right?
Agent: But because you are not a civil, you did not shift.
User: Right?
Agent: And when your EMI shifts through MBFC, our main motive is not only to educate the children
User: but also to personally support and appreciate them.
Agent: So after that, you have a mock interview.
User: You get support in all your resume building.
Agent: So that process has not been completed yet.
User: That is why I called.
Agent: Because next month your EMI will not go because of that.
User: And it will be late.
Agent: So it will be overdue.
User: Right?
Agent: So that is why I called to ask why your process has not been completed yet.
User: Because of the screen, I think so.
Agent: Okay, you were busy, that's why he couldn't do it, right?
User: But please complete it.
Agent: Check the shipping once, how much it is.
User: Because you will have an issue in giving the M.I. from next month.
Agent: So that's why I called you again to inform you.
User: Here everything is there.
Agent: Already your PAN card is there.
User: In which your date of birth is 24-02-2002.
Agent: Your Aadhaar card photo is also there.
User: And all the details are there, but some details are not there.
Agent: Okay?
User: You have put your address, 111 Mahavir Nagar.
Agent: Right bus stand, first class.
User: So there are some details and some are not there.
Agent: So please check the shipping once, how much it is.
User: It is shown on Google Pay or Phone Pay.
Agent: Yes, you will see it on Google Pay.
User: Okay, thank you.
Agent: That's the same thing.
User: That's the same thing.
Agent: I will try to get the PAN card.
User: Okay, thank you.
Agent: Thank you very much.
User: Okay, thank you.
Agent: Thank you.
User: Thank you.
Agent: Thank you.
User: Hello, yes, it's asking for the PAN card right now.
Agent: I don't have it in my phone.
User: It's in my laptop.
Agent: I will tell you the PAN card number.
User: I have your PAN card.
Agent: Okay, okay.
User: Wait, one minute.

User: No civil score.
Agent: Yes, sir.
User: I'll be calling back.
Agent: There are two possible reasons.
User: You may have leveled out.
Agent: You may have never taken a credit loan, loan on debt, or might not have enough data about
User: your credit history.
Agent: Okay.
User: Okay.
Agent: Okay.
User: Okay.
Agent: Okay.
User: Okay.
