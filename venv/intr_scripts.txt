NxtWave Onboarding Narrative (Detailed English Version) 

 

Section 1: Introduction & Rapport Building 

Objective: 

Ensure the parent is fully attentive, build emotional connection, and position this conversation as crucial to the child's future. 

Script: 

Greeting & Permission to Proceed 

    Hello, am I speaking with Mr./Mrs. ? 

    Good day! How are you doing today? 

    I am , a Registration Expert from the NxtWave Team. 

    Your child has successfully reserved a seat in our program, and I’m calling to guide you through the next steps of the process. 

    Would you have 10 minutes right now to discuss this important matter? 

If they say NO: 

    I completely understand, but this is about your child’s career and future. It’s a very important decision, and I would really appreciate if we could take just 10 minutes. 

    If they agree: Proceed to the next step. 

    If no response or decline: That’s alright. When would be a good time to connect again? We receive 10-15 applications daily, so if you can suggest a convenient time, I’ll schedule it accordingly and send a WhatsApp confirmation. 

If they say YES: 

    Great! You've taken a remarkable step for 's future. Very few parents think ahead and take proactive action when it comes to career development. 

 

Section 2: Appreciation and Icebreaking 

Objective: 

Establish trust, make them feel proud, and reinforce the value of their decision. 

Script: 

    First of all, congratulations! Your child has successfully reserved their seat in the program. 

    Every month, hundreds of students attend our webinars, but only about 30-40 students are selected by our career guidance team. 

    has been selected, showed initiative, and took guidance to reserve a seat. That is a big step. 

    Only a handful of students show this kind of early focus on their careers and current industry-relevant skills. is one of them. 

    The CGE shared that you were deeply involved, spent 2-3 hours understanding the program, and showed great interest and support. That’s amazing. 

Building Rapport 

    May I ask what you do for a living, ? 

    Oh really? That’s great. (Ask relevant follow-up to build rapport) 

    Where are you based currently? 

    Is living with you or in a hostel? 

    How is he/she performing in academics these days? 

Note: Spend at least 5 minutes here. Avoid politics, religion, or caste. If the parent goes there, steer the conversation gently back. 

 

Section 3: Product Value & Outcome Explanation 

Objective: 

Clearly communicate the gap in traditional education and how NxtWave uniquely solves it. 

Script: 

    Have you already understood what this course is about? 

If NO: 

Explain the Education Gap: 

    In most colleges, students learn only theoretical concepts. There is very little practical exposure. 

Use Car Example: 

    Imagine someone learning how a car works through diagrams on a board. They write an exam and pass. 

    Now, if we give them an actual car and ask them to drive, can they? 

    Let them answer 

    Exactly. They can’t, because they never practiced. 

    The same is happening in education. Students know the theory, but when it comes to doing the job, they don’t have practical skills. 

How NxtWave Fills the Gap: 

    Our course is completely hands-on. Students work on real-time projects. 

    These are the same skills and tools used in top companies. 

    Today, even top college graduates mostly get ₹3–4 LPA jobs. Only the top 10% get ₹12–18 LPA. 

    We help bridge this gap through our structured and practical curriculum. 

Individual Development Plan (IDP) 

    Every student has a custom learning plan, depending on how fast they learn. 

    Some are fast learners, some need more time. We personalize their journey accordingly. 

Learning Journey: 

    Students go through 6 Growth Cycles. 

    Start with basics like creating static websites. Then move to SQL, Python, React JS, dynamic apps like Facebook, Netflix. 

    Internship eligibility begins at Growth Cycle 5. 

    Every student is assigned a Success Coach for motivation, guidance, and ongoing support. 

 

Section 4: Pricing & Payment Options 

Objective: 

Get confirmation on pricing and help them choose a payment mode. 

Script: 

    Since the seat has been reserved, let’s talk about the next step: payment. 

    Can you confirm what fee details our CGE shared with you? 

Two Payment Options: 

    Full Payment 

    Digital Loan via NBFC (No-Cost EMI) 

    Which of these options would be more convenient for you? 

    [Optional Upsell]: Most parents prefer 24-month EMI for better manageability over 36-month. 

 

Section 5: NBFC & Loan Process Explanation 

Objective: 

Help parents feel safe about EMI process and understand NBFC role. 

Script: 

What are NBFCs? 

    NBFCs are Non-Banking Financial Companies. 

    We partnered with them so students can pay in monthly installments, instead of a large upfront fee. 

    Many students miss such opportunities because they can't pay full fees at once. NBFCs help solve that. 

Benefits of Digital Loan: 

    Pay small monthly amounts. 

    No collateral required. 

    Completely interest-free. 

    100% digital. No paperwork or branch visits. 

Why NBFCs, Not Direct Payment to NxtWave? 

    We are a product-focused company. Managing EMI collections ourselves would require massive manpower. 

    Instead, NBFCs manage this securely, which lets us focus on student success. 

Our Partner NBFCs: 

    Bajaj Finserv 

    Varthana 

    Feemonk 

    Shopse 

    All are RBI-approved and top-rated. 

 

Section 6: KYC & Right Co-Applicant (RCA) 

Objective: 

Ensure correct documents and eligible co-applicant are provided. 

Why Co-Applicant is Required: 

    For EMI approval, a financially eligible co-applicant is needed. 

    This person needs to provide: 

    PAN (ID proof) 

    Aadhaar (Address proof) 

    Bank Proof (passbook / cancelled cheque / statement) 

    Live photo 

    15-sec consent video 

Sample Video Content: 

    "I, , am providing my documents for ’s NxtWave course and digital loan process." 

Check CIBIL Score: 

    Ask the parent to check and send a screenshot of their CIBIL score. 

    Confirm employment status and monthly income. 

If Parent is Not Eligible: 

    Ask who else in the family can be the co-applicant. 

    Guide them to talk to that person with confidence, using the value narrative. 

 

Section 7: Resistance Handling (Highly Elaborated) 

1. CGE Didn't Explain EMI/Loan 

Response: 

    I understand, sometimes we focus so much on how the program benefits the student that the financial process may not be fully absorbed. 

    EMI is just another way to pay monthly. Like when we buy a phone or a fridge. 

    It’s the same secure process. Also, our team spent 30–40 minutes, and it’s possible this part was missed. 

2. Don’t Want Loan 

Response: 

    What concerns you about a loan? 

    Many parents associate loans with risk. But this is not a typical loan with interest or heavy penalties. 

    This is a no-cost EMI through digital platforms, like Flipkart or Amazon offer for laptops. 

    You’re not paying extra, just spreading the cost monthly. 

    Many of our parents are farmers, homemakers, shopkeepers. They found this very helpful. 

3. Don’t Want Auto Debit / PIN & OTP 

Response: 

    This is not NxtWave asking for your PIN. Your bank asks for it to confirm that monthly payment should go from your account. 

    It’s like any online purchase where you authorize payment using OTP. 

    The platform used is government-approved (NPCI). 

4. What if NxtWave Shuts Down? 

Response: 

    That’s a valid concern. But let’s look at the facts. 

    We are recognized by NSDC (National Skill Development Corporation). 

    Received ₹275 Cr in Series-A funding from reputed global investor Greater Pacific Capital. 

    Publicly appreciated by KTR (Minister of IT, Telangana) and partnered with AP Innovation Center. 

    Institutions like this don’t invest in companies that aren’t sustainable. 

5. Financial Struggles 

Response: 

    I understand your situation. Let’s explore what’s truly stopping us. 

    Can I ask about your monthly income, any siblings studying, and family commitments? 

    Your child joined this because you believed it could change their future. 

    We're here to support. Let’s find a way – even a partial payment option. 

6. Resistance in Uploading Consent Video 

Response: 

    The video is just for consent confirmation. It ensures transparency. 

    It's not shared anywhere. Only for internal verification. 

 

Section 8: Closing & Urgency Hooks 

    Are you ready to proceed with document submission? 

If Yes: Proceed with application. 

If No: 

    Let me explain why timing is crucial. 

    We have an exclusive Generative AI Workshop coming up with Tezan Sahu (Microsoft Engineer). 

    It’s available only for students who complete onboarding in 2 days. 

    Let’s not delay and miss out on this valuable opportunity.
